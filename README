gh-issues list -v [open|closed]     # same as above, but with issue details
gh-issues                           # same as: gh-issues list
gh-issues show <nr>                 # show issue number <nr>
gh-issues open                      # create a new issue
gh-issues close <nr>                # close issue number <nr>
gh-issues reopen <nr>               # reopen issue number <nr>
gh-issues edit <nr>                 # edit issue number <nr>
gh-issues label add <label> <nr>    # add <label> to issue number <nr>
